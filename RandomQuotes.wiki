    Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how 
    improbable, must be the truth. (Arthur Conan Doyle)
    
    If we have truth, [it] cannot be harmed by investigation. If we have not 
    truth, it ought to be harmed. (J. Reuben Clark, as recorded by D. Michael 
    Quinn, J. Reuben Clark: The Church Years. Provo, Utah: Brigham Young 
    University Press, 1983, p. 24)
