I went and installed XUbuntu on my laptop. It wasn't as straight forward as I 
planned. This was my eighth attempt at installing Linux on this particular 
laptop.

The first few attempts didn't work at all. Something with the installer just 
didn't want to play right. It kept looking for a CD, which didn't exist, to 
install the reamining components. This was with Linux Mint xfce edition.

Then my computer wouldn't boot at all. It said there wasn't a bootable drive, 
and I needed to create one. That was fun.

So I kept trying.

Finally I came across XUbuntu and attempted that. It wouldn't boot from the 
flash drive, it was missing soemthing in the boot loader. So I did a quick 
google and came across an answer. Sweet, that worked like a charm.

I was able to boot into the laptop and install XUbuntu without problem.

Now my laptop is happy and there's nothing wrong with that.
