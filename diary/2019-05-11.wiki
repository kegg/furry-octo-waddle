The past always has a way of coming back to haunt you. There's nothing wrong 
with what happened, the past just does what it will do. The memories come back 
never to really fully go away. Some say it's a help, a way to warn yourself of 
the possible roads that can be taken. Yet, it doesn't feel that way. Doesn't 
always feel that way at all. So here we sit, reliving the past...always living 
the past in the mind.
