Oh life, where did you end up being this way? Or why rather. Yes, that would 
make a bit more sense. Why did you end up being this way? Silly thoughts coming 
and going and never a full answer for any of it. So that's what life will do 
with you. That's how it will eventually come about and everything will come to 
an end...maybe.

Who knows what will happen in this life. It is but a thought process which no 
one really has a clue.
