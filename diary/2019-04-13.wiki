You would think life would make sense by now. I mean there could be so many 
things in this life to simply make sense. Want to be happy? Make it happen. Is 
that the only way to be happy in this life? If *you* decide to make that change? 
It's possible.

People can change if they want to. People have the ability for change. There's 
nothing wrong with change. Change can be a good thing in life. If people wish to 
change, then they will have to make that change themselves. No one can force 
change upon you. If you are not mentally ready for such a change, you will not 
make any kind of change that is requested or expected.
