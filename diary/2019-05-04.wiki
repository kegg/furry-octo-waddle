Too many thoughts today. They come and go, I guess that's an okay thing to 
happen? I'm not sure. Whatever happens happens though. Nothing you can do about 
it. Let it come and be what it will be.

To have faith in an unseen person, an unknown person, a forgotten person...yet 
known only through history is not an easy task. One must be able to set aside 
everything they think and know, then they must allow that faith to work within 
them. It is a challenge. Yet challenges must be made and conquered.

Then there are the comments to doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith. 
Well, what if you don't have faith in the things which can be doubted? What do 
you do then? Makes little sense to doubt your doubts if you have no faith, 
doesn't it? Yeah... something like that.
