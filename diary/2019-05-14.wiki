Another day has come and well gone. What do you do at that point? Does it feel 
like the day will actually be worth something? I'm not sure. Whatever happens it 
just happens and this life will continue onward without anything caring about 
what happens. So that's life. If you do what you'll do, you'll just do it. Sure 
that doesn't make sense right now. It probably won't ever make sense, but it 
works. Doesn't that work? Maybe.
