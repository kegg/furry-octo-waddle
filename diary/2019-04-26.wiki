Another day to be alive. That's good enough right? One would hope so. I mean, we 
live here for a reason and reasons become better than others. Perhaps we are 
just meant to live and there's nothing wrong with that. So many options come 
along our way in this life. We aren't meant to explore every single possibility, 
only the ones that make sense to us. To expore every possibility, that would 
take years and we don't have that many years to live; being limited by our own 
lifespans. Yeah, something like that.

To live a life that's true to you, you must be true to it. If you stand for 
something stand for it. Do not flip flop back and forth on an issue. If you know 
what is right, stand for it. If you do not know if it is true or not? Find out 
the truth and then stand for that truth.

John 8:31-32

    Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my 
    word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and 
    the truth shall make you free.
    
So truth is the key to this life right? We must have truth in our lives in order 
to understand it and to believe it. If we are misled by half truths or truths 
which turn out to be lies, how can we believe in anything?
