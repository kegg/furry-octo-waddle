Another day to be alive. That's good enough right? One would hope so. I mean, we 
live here for a reason and reasons become better than others. Perhaps we are 
just meant to live and there's nothing wrong with that. So many options come 
along our way in this life. We aren't meant to explore every single possibility, 
only the ones that make sense to us. To expore every possibility, that would 
take years and we don't have that many years to live; being limited by our own 
lifespans. Yeah, something like that.
