Being sick really sucks. I mean, what kind of person likes to be sick? I sure 
don't. There are many ideas why being not sick is so much better for you. Being 
not sick means you feel good. Feeling good is a wonderful thing! But here I am 
and I'm actualy sick. So what is there to be done about that? Not much I'm 
afraid. Not much at all.

So sick I shall be until it decides to just go away.
