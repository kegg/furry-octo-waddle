What exactly is the Sabbath day? Well it's a day of rest. A day of rest can mean 
many things to different people, and that's okay. If you feel like just 
relaxing? Relax. If you want to be active and go out and do something? Do it. 
Either way? It's a day you decide what to do. So that's all which matters.
