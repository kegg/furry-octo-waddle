So many thoughts in the head come around. Too many ideas to try and comprehend. 
There could be reasons for this, yet we do not have all of the answers. Some 
would have you believe one religion has all the answers and everything is fine. 
Based on that one religion, which is the only true religion on the face of the 
Earth.

If there is simply only one true religion on the face of the Earth, why are some 
churches bigger than others, why are some churches smaller than others? It is a 
goood question. Eventually it will come out in the wash right? I suppose so. 
Either way, we are here...and that's all that will happen.
