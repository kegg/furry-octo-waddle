There are days and then there are days. Not feeling well is not a good way to 
start or end a day. Fever? You betcha. Cough? Kinda. Cold sweats? Yes! So that's 
exactly how things work these days when you're just not feeling good. Which 
is...okay I suppose? Maybe not. Who's to exactly knkow what's going on anymore. 
This life is simply a life full of whatever comes your way.

So here we are.

Waiting for something to happen. Waiting for anything to happen. It just causes 
issues down the road. Whatever takes palce after that? That's up to you.
