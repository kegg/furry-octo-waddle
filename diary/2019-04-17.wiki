Today feels different somehow. I'm not sure exactly how different it is, but it 
is a little off. Something off doesn't always matter, well not always. Other 
times, that something different is quite an experience. So we live and we hope 
that something else comes our way in an attempt for everything else to be 
understood. So that's where it all goes and that's where everything else will 
eventually lead...at least until the end of the road is found.
