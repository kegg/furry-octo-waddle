Another week begins, I suppose that's an okay thing to happen. Life comes and 
goes as it is. But that's life for you. There's no reason to hold anything 
against it. Life will simply be life. No matter what you do, you really don't 
have any kind of control over it. That's how life takes place.

Sometimes you wish you could have a better handle on it all, yet that doesn't 
happen. Life finds a way to detour you down different paths and you don't know 
where you're going after that. So you hang on for the ride and see where it 
takes you.

It's not very glamorous at all. Life isn't meant to be that way. It's just meant 
to be simple. Simple life with the simple trials that come with it. However not 
every trial is a simple one. Some trials are more difficult than others. Yet 
here we are waiting for some kind of end to eventually come our way. Why bother 
with that which we have no control over? There's no reason to worry about it.
