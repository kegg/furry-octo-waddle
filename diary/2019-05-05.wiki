Life has the ability to be weird at times. Not sure if weird is the right word 
for it, but it is what it is. So we simply try and continue on with life 
whatever comes our way. There's nothing wrong with that thought. It happens. 
Life can be a good thing. Don't forget that. It happens.

Truth comes at a cost. Doesn't it always? People say they have the truth, yet 
they cannot defend the truth fully. They try to, but simply run around the truth 
with nonsense. In the end, the truth has not been defended at all. It has simply 
been redirected to things which don't make sense.

Either you have the truth and can defend it, or you do not. Is that not the 
simplest form to put all of this? I would go into issues, but they have been 
hashed out for so long. After so many years the questions remain. There haven't 
been any answers to fully answer the questions. If there had been actual 
answers? The questions wouldn't still be asked.
