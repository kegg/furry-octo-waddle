Life has the ability to make you wonder and think long before you even want to. 
So many opportunities out there to decide upon. Almost to the point where you 
don't know what to believe or think anymore. It's okay to not have all the 
answers to life. That's 100% okay. People need to understand that. Not a lot of 
people do however and it brings about sadness.
