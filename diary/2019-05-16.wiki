The weekend draws nigh. That means it's close right? I sure hope that's what 
it means because well the weekend is pretty darn close! I enjoy that thought. 
Time to just relax and kick back. There's nothing wrong with that at all. So 
here we are waiting for the weekend to come, and that's all which matters most. 
Silly life, waiting around for something to happen.

That's not always how life is meant to work. Sometimes you have to go out and 
make something happen. You can't always wait around for something to take place. 
Nope, that doesn't always work.
