People will believe what they wish to believe. There's no doubt to that. Some 
people will have blind faith and obedience without a second thought. Others will 
think things through and question and ask, hoping to receive an answer. There 
are others who will flat out not believe anything. Which is correct? Which is 
right? Does it matter in the long run of this life?

It' an amusing thought to be sure.
