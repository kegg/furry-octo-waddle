Changes happen. There's nothing wrong with changes, changes can be good. Yet 
cahnges because of simply having changes? Not sure that's the right route to 
have them take place. Everyone has a reason to either accept or reject changes, 
they have to have that personal experience regarding them. Call it personal 
revelation, or whatever you wish to call it. Everyone is entitled to have that 
spiritual process available to them.
