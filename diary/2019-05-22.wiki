There are many different kinds of games. Some games  you are a character that 
moves around a screen. Other games are text in nature. You simply state what you 
want and see what happens. This can happen either by clicking a keyboard or by a 
mouse. Well you type on a keyboard don't you, not really clicking a keyboard. 
You know what I mean.

Choose your own advenutre kind of games, they had books why not a game? There 
have been many types of games over the years. The good ol' days as it were. No 
one really plays those kinds of games anymore. People want the latest and 
greatest in 3D etc. the old ways just don't hold up anymore.
