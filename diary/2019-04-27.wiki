The weekend always feels like a good thing. It happens more than you could 
imagine. But that's not what matters the most. To have an idea of where you're 
headed throughout this life, that's the key point of it all. See where you're 
going. See where everything else will lead and see what happens.

What exactly is a "faith crisis"? I've heard that phrase over and over again. 
People's faith can be intact, just because they lose interest or don't believe 
in a specific church anymore does not mean they've lost faith in Jesus Christ or 
their belief in God.

It is interesting to note that there were people who learned about God and His 
ways before modern prophets. Even during a time when Christ's church was not 
found on the Earth. Some would call this blasphemy, no such thing could happen. 
I suppose they could fall into the same category as those who believe that God's 
church never left the Earth and there wasn't an apostasy. Either way? It's 
interesting.
