Another day...a new week. What's there to happen in a week? It doesn't always 
make all the sense in the world, yet here we are. Is that a good enough answer? 
I'm not sure. Should it be a good enough answer? I don't know. It could be a 
better answer than the one I am able to come up with at the moment. Whatever 
that answer will be? Here I am and I will deal with that for now.

Next week will be another week...something kinda obvious. But it's not like all 
other weeks at all. It will be ... I don't know what kind of week it will be. 
Let's just say I'm not looking forward to that week. Is that fair enough? Maybe.
Perhaps. We'll see what happens.
