Not everything in this life happens the way you expect or want it to. Isn't that 
the simplest thought process of it? You might think or want something to occur, 
it doesn't so what do you do next? You move on. It's that simple, isn't it? 
Something doesn't happen the way you expect it to go, so you move on. Pick up 
your pieces and just let go of the rest of it. There's nothing wrong with that 
thinking. It's okay to move forward.

Each person has their own journey to deal with. That's how this life happens. 
Everyone is different with a unique story to tell.
