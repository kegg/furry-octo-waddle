There are issues in life where nothing seems to fully matter. Then there are 
other things which actually do matter. Did I say issues? I meant phases of life. 
Yeah, phases would make more sense now wouldn't it? Yeah that's what I'm 
thinking. Either way, we are here and we do things that are either good for us 
or bad for us. We know if they are good and healthy or terrible for us. It's not 
for anyone else to decide.
