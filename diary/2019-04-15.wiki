Wait a second, what am I doing here? Oh right! I wanted to write in a journal 
day after day to see what it was like and see if it's actually possible. Well, 
here I am. It's one of those days. I'm not sure what to think about any of it 
just that today exists.

Probably not the best thing to happen right? Well, I suppose that doesn't 
matter. If it, that is this life, is meant to be understood I highly doubt any 
of it will make any sense ever again. So there's that! Who cares. It doesn't 
matter to anyone else. Why should it bother me?

It doesn't. It shouldn't. Yeah... something like that. Such an odd life to 
behold. We live, we die...we live some more and hopefully we'll end up someplace 
nice in the end. If we don't? Well...I suppose that doesn't matter anymore 
right?

Maybe not. Maybe so...who really knows anymore?

I sure don't.
