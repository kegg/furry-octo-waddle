Hello World! Still sick. Imagine that. Not feeling great. Taking the meds as 
prescribed. It's a good thing. Keep on keeping on.

Let's think about life for a moment. You are taught something from the start, 
the beginning of your life as it were. Constantly reminded that this is the only 
path, the only way to go.

You've learned this for years. Learned it over and over again. It's been drilled 
into your head until it's no longer a question.

Then, one day, you come across some information. Your first instinct is to not 
look at it, don't even bother with it. But then you remember some words that we 
are to search out truth and seek. So you do. It's from a soruce you've been told 
is approved, should be fine right? What's the problem.

The evidence brings about questions. Those questions don't have answers attached 
to them. The document or article only goes so far. The answers are simply not 
there. So what is a person to do with this knowledge? Trying to share it with 
others and looking for truth doesn't work. People don't want to know there are 
issues out there. They are happy and peaceful not knowing.

When you do attempt to show them the article or whatever you found, they look at 
you with disgust and ask where you found it. If you tell them from an approved 
source, they don't believe you.

If you're lucky they won't turn you away completely. Not everyone is so lucky.
