To be said by some "I know" is enough for them. To others "I believe" is enough. 
Yet for those who do not know or believe it is a different matter. One can say 
they know or they beleive all the day long, but if they don't actually know or 
beleive something to be true? What's the point? Are they trying to trick their 
mind into knowing or believing something they don't? It's an odd question to be 
certain. But it is a question to behold for sure.
