Sometimes, no matter what you do, life will just mess with you. It's how life 
is. I wish it wasn't like that, but well it is so you have to roll with whatever 
punches come your way. There's nothing wrong with this, it all depends on how 
you take it. So you have the ability to see what happens from there on out.
