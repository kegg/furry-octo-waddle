Somedays you have to deal with thoughts you never wanted to deal with before. It 
happens alright? It's a thing. You just deal with it. However, when it comes 
time to talking about such thoughts that becomes an even more difficult process.

You get aksed a question, and next thing you know you have to be able to explain 
yourself. If you don't? People begin to question you even more. Simple? Perhaps. 
Well it depends on what your thoughts are to begin with. If you don't have the 
answers to your own beliefs, then you need to have such thoughts figured out.

Do it now.
