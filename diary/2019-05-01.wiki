Life is odd at times. I just don't know how to say it exactly. Is that a bad 
thing? Is that a good thing? Either way? It's different and strange and I don't 
always know how best to deal with any of it. So here we are, or here I am. yeah 
something like that. Is that a good enough response? I'm not sure. It would be 
wonderful if that were the case, but I'm sure there are many more kinds of 
thoughts out there which I just don't know what to do with. So here we go.

I remember being in Seminary, and the teacher would give us writing time. We 
would liken things unto ourselves as we would read from the scriptures, or watch 
a video. As time moved on, we were meant to make it more about us and be tons 
more specific. I didn't really follow through with that thought, and just kept 
things generic as possible.

I wonder if it would be helpful to actually try that now. I don't think it would 
hurt anything, might be useful? I don't know. We'll have to see how it goes, if 
it goes etc.
