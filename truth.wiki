%title What Is Truth?

= What Is Truth? =

Many people come into this world wondering what this life is all 
about. There's not a problem with that question. Yet, some people 
think there is a problem with thinking about such matters.

Other people want to know why certain things were done the way they 
were. It's not to say that people have been wrong all their lives 
in their way of thinking, but it is possible they weren't right with 
some of their thought processes.

History has shown that falsehoods have been told to people, and other 
people later on have dismissed those falsehoods as they set the record 
straight. Other times it was simply a product of poor record keeping 
over the years. People didn't write things down as they happened, 
records were made years after where memory was faulty etc.

In order to get to the truth of something, we must be able to 
research and look at all of the different possibilities that 
caused the issue to exist. Questions lead to answers. Answers 
lead to either confirmation of the initial question or a fault in the question.

Are we not promised:

    Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye. shall find; knock, and it 
    shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he 
    that seeketh. findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
    (Matt 7:7-8)
