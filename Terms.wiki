*Belief Bias*

    Wikipedia - Belief Bias is the tendency to judge the strength of arguments 
    based on the plausibility of their conclusion rather than how strongly they 
    support that conclusion. A person is more likely to accept an argument that 
    supports a conclusion that aligns with his values, beliefs and prior 
    knowledge, while rejecting counter arguments to the conclusion.

*Cognitive Dissonance*

    noun - The state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes,
    especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change.
    
    Wikipedia - In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental
    discomfort (psychologial stress) experienced by a person who holds two or
    more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. This discomfort is triggered
    by a situation in which a person's belief clashes with new evidence 
    perceived by the person. When confronted with facts that contradict beliefs, 
    ideas, and values, people will try to find a way to resolve the 
    contradiction to reduce their discomfort.
