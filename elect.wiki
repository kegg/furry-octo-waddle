= Very Elect =

But who is the very elect exactly?

Matthew 24:24

    For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great 
    signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the 
    very elect.
    
I mean, it could be said that anyone could be a very elect person, couldn't it? 
Doesn't make quite much sense to me. I mean, if anyone can be the very elect, 
does that mean one of the higher ups can be deceived, or will be deceived? 
They're high up in the church, if they are deceived and one is told to follow 
the prophet, then what happens exactly?
