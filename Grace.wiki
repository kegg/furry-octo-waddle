1 Corinthians 15:1-4

     Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, 
     which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
     
     By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, 
     unless ye have believed in vain.
      
     For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, 
     how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
     
     And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day 
     according to the scriptures:

Ephesians 2:8-9

     For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of 
     yourselves: it is the gift of God:

     Not of works, lest any man should boast.
