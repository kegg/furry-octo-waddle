3 Nephi 27:13-17

    Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you-that 
    I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.

    And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that 
    I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as 
    I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to 
    stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil-

    And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the 
    Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.

    And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be 
    filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before 
    my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.

    And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down 
    and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father.
